# Simple Bank Account Simulator

This is a basic Python script that simulates a bank account with deposit, withdrawal, and balance check functionality. It uses a password to secure withdrawals.

## 🧾 Features

- Deposit funds into the account
- Withdraw funds with password protection
- Check current balance
- Simple command-line interface

## 💡 How It Works

- A `BankAccount` class is used to manage account operations.
- The user is prompted with a menu to choose actions.
- Withdrawals require password input for security.

## 🔐 Default Setup

- Account password is hardcoded as `1234` in the script.
- Balance starts at `0`.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Save the script as `bank_account.py`
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Run the script:
```bash
python bank_account.py
